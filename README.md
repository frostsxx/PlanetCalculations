Did you know that your age would be different on another planet? Different planets orbit the sun at different rates, so 1 year on earth can be much shorter or much longer on another planet, depending on their position in the solar system.

To calculate a personâ€™s age on another planet, we need to know how long it takes each planet to orbit the Sun (relative to a year on Earth):

Jupiter takes 11.86 years
